    <h4>Let's learn how to make a classic margherita pizza!</h4>
    <p>I've tried several margherita pizza recipes, and this is the one I've always gone back to.</p>

    <p>Margherita pizza is great because it doesn't take a ton of ingredients to make, at least
      as far as toppings are concerned. The result will be an absolutely perfect pizza that
      you can share with the whole family. Note that we're making the sauce and toppings from scratch,
      but the dough can be purchased at your local grocery store.</p>

    <ul>Pizza Sauce Ingredients
      <li>1 cup pureed or crushed canned San Marzano tomatoes (or canned Italian plum tomatoes)</li>
      <li>2-3 fresh garlic cloves (grated with a microplane or pressed)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil (plus more for drizzling)</li>
      <li>2-3 large pinches of kosher salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>Toppings
      <li>2-3 tablespoons finely grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese (plus more for serving)</li>
      <li>7 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil (plus more for drizzling)</li>
      <li>5-6 large fresh basil leaves (plus more for garnishing)</li>
      <li>dried red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>Steps
      <li><strong>Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone:</strong> Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second
          to top rack of your oven (roughly 8 inches from the broiler element), and preheat the
          oven and steel (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for a minumum of 1 hour. If your oven does
          not go up to 550°F (285°C) or you are using a delicate pizza stone, I recommend heating
          it to a maximum of 500°F (260°C)</li>
      <li>As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the
          pureed tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another
          small bowl with the cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any
          excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy
          grabbing.</li>
      <li>Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK.
          Place the dough on a large plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and
          allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong> Sprinkle the pizza peel (if you do not own a pizza peel, you can
          try using the back of a half sheet pan - but it is tricky!) with a tablespoon of semolina
          and dusting of all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to stretch one ball of pizza dough
          into roughly a 10-inch circle (don’t worry if its not perfectly uniform). If the dough
          springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for an additional five minutes. The edges
          of the dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is thin (you
          should be able to see some light through it if you held it up). Gently transfer the dough
          onto the semolina and flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon.
          Using a large spoon, add roughly ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a
          ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly.
          Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed
          mozzarella, distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large
          basil leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, I’ll occasionally stretch
          the sides of the dough out a bit to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel
          onto the heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the
          cheese is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. <strong>Note:</strong>
          If you're looking for more color, finish the pizza under the low or medium broil setting, but
          watch it carefully!</li>
      <li>Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting
          board or foil, drizzle the top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and
          chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza.</li>
      <li><strong>Serving Tip:</strong> If you’re serving two pizzas at once, I recommend placing the
          cooked pizza on a separate baking sheet while you prepare the other pizza. In the last few
          minutes of cooking, place the prepared pizza into the oven (on a rack below the pizza stone)
          so that it is extra hot for serving. Otherwise, I recommend serving one pizza fresh out of the
          oven, keeping the oven hot, and preparing the second pizza after people have gone through the
          first one! The pizza will taste great either way, but it is at its prime within minutes out of
          the oven!.</li>
